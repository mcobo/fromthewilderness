> When writing about outsider agents that can enter from the edges and take over our lives, you better explain why you're doing it.

# If you’re reading this, you’re taking a step into the most unusual of experiments 

It’s taken a while for me to give shape to this idea I had, and it seems ever so fitting that it happened on the Feast of St. John the Forerunner, a dweller of the wilderness. I don’t want to make this about myself, but I did want to start by writing down about how this little project came to be and where it comes from. It’s a public post and written as if it was fully intended for an audience, but it will serve more than anything as a guide for myself on what I’m doing. So let’s begin, shall we?

# Who am I?

My name is Bernardo Gutierrez. Google can probably give you an idea of what I do professionally, but here are the core things. I am a scientist. For now, I work in an entirely academic setting - as a postdoctoral researcher in a British University. I studied biological sciences, and progressively specialised as an evolutionary biologist and epidemiologist. It sounds like an unusual combination, but it works particularly well for the subjects of study which most entices me: emerging viruses. We’ll get back to that later.

I am a Christian - Catholic to be specific. I was raised as, then lapsed and finally returned to the Roman Catholic Church over the course of my late teens and adult life. By my nature and inclinations, faith has always been very intelectual for me; I am fascinated by theology and philosophy, even when I am too unknowledgeable to truly consider myself a philosopher or theologian - even an amateur one. Despite the religious tradition I inherited, you will quickly notice something as I flesh out my ideas in this blog: they draw from modern interpretations of much more ancient traditions, predominantly Orthodox. I don’t know if this is a recent phenomenon, but as many others I have been captivated by the ancient Eastern Christian tradition and thought. A lot of my worldview on this blog will closely follow my interpretation of propositions from the likes of Jonathan Pageau (and his podcast/project The Symbolic World), and Fathers Andrew Stephen Damick and Stephen De Young (and their podcast The Lord of Spirits, on Ancient Faith Radio), which in turn derive from Patristics and the ancient traditions of the Church of Christ. I don’t claim to have a complete grasp of either my own Roman Catholic tradition nor the Eastern Orthodox tradition, but I hope that this exercise will also help me in my own catechesis, discernment and repentance.

As an academic who (unsurprisingly) leans towards over-intellectualising, it is easy to lose sight of how to act out a proper orientation towards God, the highest good. I believe that the virtues so insightfully presented by St. Thomas Aquinas (prudence, justice, temperance and courage) are an important part of a Christian faith, and that these go together with spiritual practices such as fasting, praying and giving to others. I strive to not fall into the temptation of thinking without embodying.

# Viruses from the wilderness

Emerging viruses. There are two words here, and both are important to what I do in their own right.

‘Emerging’ simply means that they are infectious agents that appear and infect populations (of humans, animals or any other living organism) that weren’t affected before. For this to happen, the infectious agent needs to have been somewhere else before ‘appearing’ in the new population. Where exactly this ‘before’ is depends on the situation, and I’m not particularly attached to any one scenario here. Before an infectious agent infects a new population, it could have been infecting people in far off communities in a different continent - this happened for example in the mid 2010s when South America started having epidemics from a mosquito-borne virus called Chikungunya virus. Before an infectious agent infects a new population, it could have been infecting animals in farms nearby - this is what happens occasionally with a virus called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, where infected camels pass on the virus to unfortunate camel herders. Before an infectious agent infects a new population, it could have been infecting animals in the forest - this happens with most new Ebola virus outbreaks in central Africa. Hell, let’s be thorough here: before an infectious agent infects a new population, it could have been infecting cell lines cultured in a laboratory - this happened in 2007 when a virus called Foot and Mouth Disease virus escaped a laboratory and caused outbreaks in cattle. I see all these ‘before’ scenarios as something which is external - the edges, the fringes, or in more biblical language, ‘the wilderness’.

‘Viruses’ is a term to describe a class of biological, material agent; however, I think that one aspect of how these microorganisms behave is noteworthy. They hijack the organisms that they infect, to some extent. This property of viruses is, I think, an intriguing aspect to how they operate in the material world. The fact that a virus takes hold and uses some part of the infected host and uses it for its own ‘purpose’ (which is proliferation in strictly evolutionary terms) is worth pondering.

# Things that spread

In a strange notion that was made popular by popular science writer (and vocal atheist) Richard Dawkins, some ‘behavioural units’ (think ideas, notions, practices…) can spread amongst humans and tend to proliferate based on their own characteristics which make them ‘fit’ or ‘successful at spreading’. This is a very brief summary of meme theory, with its name taken from the term coined to describe these ‘behavioural units’. The conditions for a meme to be successful is that it can enter our everyday life, spread between people (it can be ‘taught’ or ‘shared’) and that it has a quality of being ‘memorable’ which makes it stick. I believe that memes, both in the original sense and even in the contemporary ‘internet meme’ sense, act as a currency of agencies which we sometimes don’t fully understand, which can be thought of as egregores although I’m not entirely convinced that they just emerge from the collective.

You see, I see a lot of truth in the Jungian concept that '“people don’t have ideas, ideas have people”. Communities are bound in a sense by collections of ideas, which play a big role in shaping them. In the grander scheme of things all these ideas can merge into Hegel’s ‘spirit of the age’, or zeitgeist. This spirit roosts within human communities after it has spread and taken over, but where it comes from (or more likely, where do its many component egregores come from) and how it becomes a principality that governs peoples is something worth thinking about.

# Caveats, caveats, caveats

Things used to be much more simple in my little, niche field of study. Then a pandemic hit, and the attention of a vast and highly interconnected world flooded our domain of people studying emerging viruses. COVID-19 has been and will continue to be a controversial issue to say the least. I am entirely aware of this, not only because I have my own opinions about various topics (which are not always shared with either the majority of people, nor with the ‘scientific consensus’ a lot of the time), but also because many aspects about our individual and collective lives have been challenged by the plethora of events that have taken place with, because and as a consequence of this pandemic.

I am interested in discussing these more technical ideas - but not here. As strange as my intention seems, what I really want to do here is to take insights from how emerging pathogens behave in general, and bring them into a broader (dare I say even ‘higher’) plane. I want to take my daily work and draw something from it which isn’t limited to the technical, but that can actually enrich my own spiritual life, and hopefully the lives of others in the process. That being said, there is plenty of what COVID-19 provoked (other than the clinical and epidemiological aspects) that, I believe, has strong implications to our spiritual lives. I will certainly present these ideas in their due time.

That being said, I am also aware that some people question the very notion of ‘viruses’ or ‘infectious diseases’. As with COVID-19 in particular, I don’t want to turn this blog into an argument for the validity of what’s referred to as ‘germ theory’ - the idea that some microorganisms can enter our bodies and make us ill. Nonetheless, I believe that we have a lot to learn by looking and thinking about things that ‘spread’ between people, whether they are microorganisms or not. I hope that my insights are worthy.

# Who is this site for

Like I said, this blog will combine strange ideas which at times may even feel like an awkward fit. I expect to miss on a lot of connections, and to hit couple (hopefully more!) of insights that shine a light on these very strange times we live in. If you’re curious about modern ideas that have taken over and continue to take over society, and you have an intuition that these might come from a strange place outside our field of view, from a spiritual wilderness and perhaps even from trans-personal intelligences amongst our midst, I hope that you’ll find some of this content interesting and thought-provoking.
