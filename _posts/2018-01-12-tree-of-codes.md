If you're writing about outsider agents that can enter from the edges and take over our lives, you better explain why you're doing it.

If you’re reading this, you’re taking a step into the most unusual of experiments.

It’s taken a while for me to give shape to this idea I had, and it seems ever so fitting that it happened on the Feast of St. John the Forerunner, a dweller of the wilderness. I don’t want to make this about myself, but I did want to start by writing down about how this little project came to be and where it comes from. It’s a public post and written as if it was fully intended for an audience, but it will serve more than anything as a guide for myself on what I’m doing. So let’s begin, shall we?

> It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. 


An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”. 

The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.
