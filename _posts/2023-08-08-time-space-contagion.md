> It has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime

It’s not always obvious when precisely a situation gets out of control. I often think of this when looking at some of the more egregious ideas that make up modern thinking, or the more nefarious things happening in many corners of the internet. Surely, there must have been a time when some of these twisted modern tropes did not exist, right? Until, one day, they came into being and where embraced and popularised.

Regardless of where they come from or how they come to be, ideas and behaviours manifest at some time and place. Like an outbreak at its beginning, an agent becomes localised in some individual from which many different possible trajectories can unfold. Some infectious agents flow from the wild into human hosts yet spread no further than that first infected human; on the other hand, there are some pathogens which spread for a while amongst people after that first infected human patient until they essentially ‘run out of juice’, lose momentum and die out. Few of them build up enough momentum until they can’t be stopped, they continue infecting person after person until they settle in as regular pathogens with a persisting presence amongst humans.

Not too far from this facet of infectious diseases, cultural and mental objects like memes, ideas and behaviours can act similarly. Some are one-off occurrences that never reach beyond very niche groups of people, while others have their time under the sun before fading into obscurity. With viruses, as with ideas, knowing what makes them stick matters, and it is perhaps as important as it’s ever been to be able to discern this early on. The speed at which these (egregious) infectious ideas and behaviours spread is relentless, and knowing early on which will become commonplace becomes a tool to consciously fortify against these.

One last point worth pondering comes from understanding infectious agents, where in some instances the pathogen at its origin already contains all the features (genetic in this case) to successfully become established amongst humans. Could that also be the case for their cultural and ideological counterparts? Does an idea, a meme, a ritual or a behaviour contain all the necessary features for it to take a hold of human minds and souls? It may be so, but these minds and souls can also be in a state where they are fertile ground for being taken over and permit the invasion of this foreign agent. Church tradition, both from Scripture and from meditations such as St. Augustine’s The City of God, speak of an ancient battle between God and the Devil, and Augustine’s take on our earthly communities conforming what he calls the City of Man shed light on how we’ve toiled this fertile ground by driving our attention away from what is above.

The state of our minds and souls at this current time and place may define what spiritual demons from the wilderness will take a hold of us in the future. Makes you wonder, what state where we in back when the demons that currently plague us appeared? How did we let them?
