My name is Bernardo Gutierrez. Google can probably give you an idea of what I do professionally, but here are the core things. I am a scientist. For now, I work in an entirely academic setting - as a postdoctoral researcher in a British University. I studied biological sciences, and progressively specialised as an evolutionary biologist and epidemiologist. It sounds like an unusual combination, but it works particularly well for the subjects of study which most entices me: emerging viruses. Weâ€™ll get back to that later.
